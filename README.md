# Intro to Backend Development using Express

Until now, we focused mostly on developing the user interface and considering data as something that is given. Now, we will see how is the 'engine' of a web application created and dive into the basics of:
- [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)
- [REST APIs](https://restfulapi.net/)
- Integrating with databases and other services

You can find the final api [here](http://basic-crud.westeurope.azurecontainer.io:5000/users)

As always, the documentation is the place to start for everything. We will be using Express for our first API, but I recommend taking a look at other tools as well: [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#express), [ASP.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/getting-started-with-aspnet-web-api/tutorial-your-first-web-api), [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/quickstart), [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/), [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial01/)  

### Places to learn
- Lots of content about the principles of backend development, although not directly applied to a technology: [Hussein Nasser](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQUNnO4p00ua_C5mKTfldiYT)
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M&t=1173s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)
- Last but not least, you can learn the most by practicing. Open your IDE, and start coding ^^
